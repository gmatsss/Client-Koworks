                      You risk getting banned from Linkage if you are detected,

                      several jobs that you are qualified for and responding
                      quickly to queries is the fastest method to get hired.
                      Only apply for jobs that are a suitable match for your
                      talents and expertise. This is so you don't waste time
                      applying for jobs you don't stand a chance of getting.

                      No, however excellent English will give you an advantage.

                      Employers pay their employees directly, rather than
                      through Linkage. We do not collect a percentage of salary
                      payments as a charge. As a result, how workers are
                      compensated is decided by both the company and the
                      employee.

                      There are numerous ways for you to get paid. Depending on
                      the service you use, you may even be able to get your
                      money at home.

                      It all depends on the terms of your contract with your
                      employer. You will usually get paid every two weeks or
                      once a month. Workers should, however, request weekly pay
                      when they are first hired to reduce the danger of working
                      for a new business.
